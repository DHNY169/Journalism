How to be productive during the lockdown 
I have been talking to friends in Ireland and my family in Brazil and they are all having a nerves breaking down for limiting their activities and having to stay at home because of COVID-19.
So, I decided to make a list of activity they could do (FOR FREE) to enhance their knowledge plus help time to go faster by spending quality times inside our cosy homes.
I am not being paid to advertise any of those services, but I do appreciate there are providing these services for free.
